# Git Process
- **Step 1: Initializing Repository**

Use the command git init to start a new repository or git clone to copy an existing repository from a remote source.

- **Step 2: Add and Check Files**
- Use git add to add new files or changes to the staging area.
- **Use git status to check the status of files in the working directory.**
- **Step 3: Commit Changes**

Use git commit -m "Commit message" to commit the changes that have been added to the staging area. Each commit is a snapshot of the current state of the repository.

- **Step 4: Create and Switch Branches**
- Use git branch to view a list of branches and git branch [branch name] to create a new branch.
- **Use git checkout [branch name] or git switch [branch name] to switch to a different branch.**
- **Step 5: Merge Branches**

After working on a branch, we merged the changes from that branch into the main branch using git merge.

- **Step 6: Update Repository (Pull)**

Use git pull to update the local repository from a remote repository.

- **Step 7: Push Changes to Remote Repository (Push)**

Use git push to push commits from the local repository to the remote repository.

- **Step 8: View History and Log**

Use git log to view the commit history and changes in the repository.

- **Step 9: Handling Conflicts**

During the merge process, if conflicts arise, use merge tools like git mergetool to resolve conflicts.

- **Step 10: View and Change Uncommitted Changes**

Use git diff to view the differences between the working directory and the index/staging area or between commits.
